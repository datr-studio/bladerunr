Description: bladerunr streamlines the process of searching all valid
    combinations of model input parameters. The package enables the user
    to set up a grid search across a variety of parameters, execute a
    model, and cache the results. Finally, bladerunr smartly manages model
    execution to watch for failed runs or runs that exceed a time limit
    and deal with these according to the user's preference.
